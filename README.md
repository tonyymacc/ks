```

## Interactive Features

## CLI Commands

Simple, focused commands for quick operations. For full features, use the interactive REPL menu.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `-w, --write` | Create/overwrite note | `ks -w todo.txt "Buy milk"` |
| `-a, --append` | Append to note | `ks -a todo.txt "Walk dog"` |
| `-r, --read` | Read note in viewer | `ks -r todo.txt` |
| `-d, --delete` | Delete note | `ks -d old.txt` |
| `-h, --help` | Show help | `ks -h` |

**Tip:** Run `ks` without flags to access browse, search, sorting, and all interactive features!

## Themes

Choose from 4 beautiful color schemes via the main menu:

- **Purple (Default)** - Elegant purple/magenta tones
- **Ocean** - Cool blue/cyan palette
- **Forest** - Natural green hues
- **Sunset** - Warm orange/red colors

Change themes anytime from the main menu â†’ "Change Theme". No code editing or rebuilding required!

## Storage

Notes are stored in `~/.local/share/ks/` (XDG Base Directory specification).

## Tips

**Newlines in bash:** Use `$'\n'` for actual newlines:
```bash
ks -w note.txt $'Line 1\nLine 2'  # Correct
ks -w note.txt "Line 1\nLine 2"    # Wrong (literal \n)
```

**Piping:** Works seamlessly with pipes and redirects:
```bash
echo "content" | ks -w note.txt    # Write from stdin
ks -r note.txt | grep "keyword"    # Pipe note content
```
